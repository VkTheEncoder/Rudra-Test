"BASICS OF HTML"
" Html stands for hyper text markup language, basically it is used to develop the web pages."
" Here the word markup refers to the highlighted instance of the given aspects. i.e. an author can highlight a"
"particular word of his written document to grab the attention of the readers."
" In the similar way the hypertext markup language highlights the different views of a given web page in terms"
"of headers, titles, plain text, images, sounds, videos and etc."
" In Html, all these can be performed with the help of tags, where a tag is nothing but a special keyword"
"supported by Html which indicates in between < , > symbols."
""
""
"Creating an Html"
"1. Html code should be taken in any text editor, like notepad, etc."
"2. Every html code should begins with <html> and must be ends with </html>"
"3. The text will be placed using the structure of html code."
"4. After completion of the code, save the file using the extension “ .htm” or “.html”ex:"
"filename.html"
"5. The output of the file can be viewed using the “filename.html” on any available web browsers in our"
"computer, like Internet explorer, firefox, etc."
"6. If the browser is not displaying your expected output it means that the html code is carries some errors."
"Then we should be sufficiently debugged the program with our required output appears."
"7. It has to be notice that the html is not a case sensitive, i.e. we can write the code in upper case letters or"
"in lower case letters."
""
" HyperText"
"Hypertext means that some text in the HTML document carries a link to a different location. Such links"
"can be present either on the same page or some other page located on another computer page. On clicking this"
"'hot spot', the viewer is transferred to that location."
""
" Markup:"
"Markup means that specific portions of a document are marked up to indicate how they should be"
"displayed in the browser."
"HTML carries information about the web page though, the display of the document is solely dependent on"
"the browser. For this reason, you should test your HTML code in the two most used browsers, Internet Explorer"
"from Microsoft and Netscape Communicator from Netscape. With HTML you can embed various objects such as"
"images, video, sound in your pages."
""
" Tags:"
"In HTML, the commands or instructions are given in the form of tags. That is HTML formattingis specified by"
"using tags.A tag is a format name surrounded by angle brackets. HTML markup tags are usually called HTML"
"tags"
" HTML tags are keywords surrounded by angle brackets like <html>"

" HTML tags normally come in pairs like <b> and </b>"
" The first tag in a pair is the start tag, the second tag is the end tag"
" Start and end tags are also called opening tags and closing tags."
" They are not case sensitive: <HEAD>, <head>, and <hEaD> are equivalents;"
""
" White space, tabs, and new lines are ignored by the browser, they can be used to makethe HTML"
"source more readable without affecting the way that the page is displayed"
" Actually they’re not ignored, but multiple white spaces are replaced by a single spacewhile new lines and tabs"
"are treated as spaces."
" If a browser doesn’t understand a tag it will usually ignore it."
" Tags instruct the browser how to display HTML document code."
" It consists of a keyword enclosed within angular brackets ( < > )."
""
""
"Types of tags"
"In general there are two types of tags."
"1. Empty tags / single tags"
"2. Container tags"
""
"1. Empty tags : Empty tag represents the formatting options of text such as the line breaks, horizontal ruler,"
"paragraph and etc.."
"These tags has only single tag, mentioned as the start tag.Ex: <br>, <hr>"
"2. Container tags : Container tag has a section of text, which specifies the formatting construction for all"
"of the selected text. Container tag has two tags representing the starttag and close tag. At the end tag it"
"representing the addition of forward slash before the tag element."
"Ex : <html> …. </html>"
"<body>        …. </body>"
"<b> …. </b>"
""
"Advantages of HTML:"
""
"1.   First advantage it is widely used."
"2.   Every browser supports HTML language."
"3.   Easy to learn and use."
"4.   It is by default in every window so you don't need to purchase extra software."
""
"Disadvantages of HTML:"
""
"1.   It can create only static and plain pages so if we need dynamic pages then HTML is not useful."
"2.    Need to write lot of code for making simple webpage."
"3.    Security features are not good in HTML."
"4.    If we need to write long code for making a webpage then it produces some complexity"

"Q) Structure of HTML Program"
""
"All HTML documents follow the same basic structure. They have the root tag as <html>, which contains"
"<head> tag and <body> tag. The head tag is used for control information by the browser and the body tag contains"
"the actual user information that is to be displayed on the screen. The basic document is shownbelow."
""
""
""
""
"<html> tag:"
"The <html> tag encloses all other HTML tags and associated text within your document. It is an optional tag."
"You can create an HTML document with this tag and your web browser can still read it and display it.But it is"
"always a good form to include the start and end tags."
"<head> tag:"
"This tag comes after the HTML start tag. It contains <title> tag to give the document title that displays onthe"
"browsers title bar at the top."
"Example: <title>tutorialtpoint.net</title>"
"The <head> also consists of <meta> tag."
""
" The <meta> tag provides metadata about the HTML document. Metadata will not be displayed onthe"
"page, but will be machine parsable."
" Meta elements are typically used to specify page description, keywords, author of the document,last"
"modified and other metadata."
" The metadata can be used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), search engines"
"(keywords), or other web services."

"The <a> tag (anchor tag) in HTML is used to create a hyperlink on the webpage. This hyperlink is used to"
"link the webpage to other web pages or some section of the same web page. It’s either used to provide an"
"absolute reference or a relative reference as its “href” value."
"Syntax:"

"In the above statement"
"href – name of the source file"
"target --- name of the frame where we divide the webpage into frames"
"By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. To change this, you must specify"
"another target for the link."
"The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document."
"The target attribute can have one of the following values:"
" _self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked"
" _blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab"
" _parent - Opens the document in the parent frame"
" _top - Opens the document in the full body of the window"
"name --- provides the section for the webpage"

"E.g. <a href=”index.html”>Home page</a>"
